== Simplicity ==
!SimpleAjax remains simple by following three principles:

*Don't require code if it's not necessary.* There are two major sins inherited from the history of !JavaScript: initializing a widget by passing it a node ID, and requiring the user to manually load/unload the widget. Often times writing such code is not necessary in the first place as the application is already in an environment where it could gather that information for itself. !SimpleAjax understands this principle and is designed to avoid needing to be loaded/unloaded in the first place, and where it does need to, it handles everything by itself.

*Small APIs are fast to learn.* One requirement of !SimpleAjax is to be easy to learn and something you could start using in minutes. To meet that requirement, much focus was placed in making the core features work in as few steps as possible and requiring those steps to be easy to pick up and remember. That is why !SimpleAjax only has 1 function call and 4 parameters. We hope that after the first time, it becomes second nature from then on.

*Short syntaxes are fast to read and write.* Taking a page out of jQuery, we realized that short and concise method names coupled with uniform conventions produced code that was quick to read, yet understandable enough to not cause confusion. Also, if a block of code could all be read in 1 sitting, then the user is more likely to be able to grasp it all in their head, than a block of code that causes the user to forget what happened at the start, by the time they reach the bottom.
