== Simplicity ==
!SimpleAjax is not a [http://dojotoolkit.org toolkit] or a [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ library]. It doesn't help you write [http://www.prototypejs.org/ object-oriented code], or [http://jquery.com/ functional code], or make [http://script.aculo.us/ things fly] across the page. It doesn't try to simulate the desktop with [http://www.extjs.com widgets] and menus. Instead it is designed to do one thing only, which is to send data to the server without reloading the page. This is what AJAX is really about; enabling user-interaction without disrupting the user's work-flow.
