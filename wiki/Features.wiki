== Simplicity ==
At its core, !SimpleAjax remains simple by designing around its three principles:

  # Don't require code if it's not necessary.
  # Small APIs are fast to learn.
  # Short syntaxes are fast to read and write.

Because the goal of !SimpleAjax is so simple, it is able to achieve it without requiring an expressive language.
