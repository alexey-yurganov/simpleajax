= Method Parameters =

To invoke !SimpleAjax, add a `rel` attribute to any hyperlink or form control:

   <a href="desc.php" *rel="get # div1 loading"*>View Description</a>

This invocation consists of:
  * _"rel"_: When an element with a "rel" attribute is activated !SimpleAjax will take over and invoke the alternate AJAX behavior.

  * _[#The_Get_Method "get"]_: This must be a valid HTTP method (or variants of it) that will be used to retrieve the resource over the Internet. It can be "get", "post", or "get-nocache".

  * _[#The_#_URL "#"]_: This is a URL indicating the resource to download. Relative URLs are accepted and are relative to the implied resource at the hyperlink or form element.

  * _[#The_div1_ID "div1"]_: This is the ID of an element (on the current page) that will be used to display the server results. It also accepts "null" as a name to indicate that the response should not be displayed.

  * _[#The_loading_ID "loading"]_: This is the ID of an element that will be shown when a server request is being sent and will be hidden when the server response has arrived. Effectively this is an progress indicator.
