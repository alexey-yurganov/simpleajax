=Using !SimpleAjax=

==Add !SimpleAjax to your Website==
First add the following script tag somewhere in your HTML.
{{{
<script src="http://simpleajax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/simpleajax.js"></script>
}}}

==Customize the HTML of the Button or Link==
Then find the button or link which you want to respond to. The element can be any form element (e.g., textfield, button, selectbox, checkbox, etc.) or it can be a hyperlink. Then add a `"rel"` attribute to it.
